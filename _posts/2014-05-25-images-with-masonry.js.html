<p>From time to time masonry will calculate inaccurately because your masonry-elements contain images. The script starts calculating - whether all images already had been fully loaded or not. As a result the calculation isn't exact. To counter this behaviour there is a script available which monitors when all images are fully loaded. You can grab it <a href="http://desandro.github.io/imagesloaded/" target="_blank">here</a>:</p>

<p>Just wrap your masonry with the <span class="code">imagesLoaded();</span> function</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
var container = document.querySelector('#container');
var msnry;
// initialize Masonry after all images have loaded
imagesLoaded( container, function() {
  msnry = new Masonry( container );
});
{% endhighlight %}
