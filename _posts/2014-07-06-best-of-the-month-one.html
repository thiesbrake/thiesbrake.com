		<p>I'm a real fan of Michael Lewis. His storytelling is fabulous. This story is about Jim Clark, the founder of Silicon Graphics and Netscape.</p>

		<p>My introduction to stoicism. Ryan does a great job explaining how known philosophers like Marcus Aurelius or Epictetus saw the world.</p>

		<p>Nir writes about the process of creating habit-forming products. If you're wondering why services like Facebook or Twitter are such successes: read this one.</p>

		<p>In contrast to the other four books, this one is a classic fantasy book. A cycle consisting of 3 major parts. The last one is yet to come out, but the first 3 books (part two is split up) are great. His language and style of writing are just fun to read.</p>
