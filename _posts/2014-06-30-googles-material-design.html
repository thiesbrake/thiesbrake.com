<p>Just a week ago Google released their new design metaphor, named <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html" target="_blank"><b>Material Design</b></a>. I really enjoy their approach and I loved reading their documentation. One quote stuck in my head which I would like to share:</p>

<p class="quote">The reason why the desktop view with overlapping windows and a cursor works, isn't the fact that it looks like your physical desk, it is because when you work on your physical desk the same physical things happen. You put the important things on top, because those are the ones your are paying attention to.</p>

<p>After reading the documentation I was inspired by their new variations to animate elements. I created a quick demo to resemble some effects seen in the docs:</p>
